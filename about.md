**born2scan** is a team of students, IT Security and CTF enthusiasts from Tuscany, Italy.

We formed in 2019 at University of Florence under the [CyberChallenge.IT](https://www.cyberchallenge.it) program.

This is our shared blog that we'll use to write detailed CTF writeups of challenges we solved, misc articles, team news and announce upcoming events.
