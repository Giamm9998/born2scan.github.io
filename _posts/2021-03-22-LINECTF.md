After navigating to the challenge's IP, we are presented with a page that contains what looks like a crypto ticker, refreshing every five seconds.

![diveinternals Home](/assets/img/LINECTF_2021/diveinternals_home.png)

The **About** page doesn't contain anything interesting at first glance, and the **Subscribe** page lets us enter an email address and replies with a simple text-only confirmation.

![diveinternals Subscribe](/assets/img/LINECTF_2021/diveinternals_subscribe.png)

So, given the challenge's description, we should:

1. _Target the server's internal entries_
2. _Access admin_
3. _Roll back_

...whatever those mean. Luckily enough the source code for the challenge was given, and the team at LINE was nice enough to package everything up in Docker containers and provide a docker-compose config to reproduce their deployment on your machine. Here's a relevant excerpt (screen space is a premium resource):

```yaml
services:
    nginx:
        build:
            context: ./nginx/
        ports:
            - "12004:80"
        networks:
            - ctf-network
    public:
        build:
            context: ./public/
        networks:
            - ctf-network
    private:
        build: ./private/
        networks:
            - ctf-network
        environment:
            - 'RUN=flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000'
            - DBFILE=database/master.db
networks:
   ctf-network:
```

So, what do we have here? First things first, let's note that all the services will be running unrestricted in a common virtual network, so they'll be reachable from each other by using their service name as hostname.

An NGINX instance that reverse-proxies the `public` container, judging by the config in its build dir:

```text
server {
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://public:3000;
    }
}
```

**Note:** the complete config file had several more Lua shenanigans messing with caching and headers formatting, none of which I've recognized as useful for solving this challenge but may have given additional insights. If anything, some headers rewriting could have been needed to actually make the intended exploit work.

Next we have the `public` service, which apparently is just a frontend that calls to the `private` backend. Here are the relevant routes definitions, with context added where needed:

```js
const target = 'private:5000';

router.get('/apis/', function(req, res, next) {
  request({
    headers: req.headers,
    uri: `http://${target}/`,
  }, function(err, data){
    res.render('index', { title: 'apis' , data: data.body});
  });
  
});

router.get('/apis/addsub', function(req, res, next) {
  request({
    uri: `http://${target}/addsub`,
    qs: { email: req.query.email }
  }).pipe(res);
});
```

We can already see that the only ways we have to interact with the private backend are through GETting its root with some headers or through an `email` query parameter directed at the `addsub` endpoint.

Cutting to the juicy bits, here's a portion of the `private` service, rewritten and minimized as needed _(that is to say: don't try to paste this in an interpreter, it won't work)_:

```python
privateKey = b'let\'sbitcorinparty'

class Activity():
    def __init__(self):
        self.dbHash = hashlib.md5(open('database/master.db','rb').read()).hexdigest()
        self.integrityKey = hashlib.sha512((self.dbHash).encode('ascii')).hexdigest()

    def IntegrityCheck(self,key, dbHash):
        if self.integrityKey != key:
            # Return invalid key error
        if self.dbHash != dbHash:
            flag = RunRollbackDB(dbHash)
            file = open('database/master.db','rb').read()
            self.dbHash = hashlib.md5(file).hexdigest()
            self.integrityKey = hashlib.sha512((self.dbHash).encode('ascii')).hexdigest()
            return flag
        return "DB is safe!"

    def run(self):
        schedule.every(6).seconds.do(self.IntegrityCheck)
        schedule.every(2).seconds.do(self.UpdateIntegrityKey)
        schedule.every(2).seconds.do(self.BackupDB)

    with requests.get(url, stream=True) as r:

            # Write the contents of the response in the file

def LanguageNomarize(request):
    if request.headers.get('Lang') is None:
        return "en"
    else:
        regex = '^[!@#$\\/.].*/.*' # Easy~~
        language = request.headers.get('Lang')
        language = re.sub(r'%00|%0d|%0a|[!@#$^]|\.\./', '', language)
        if re.search(regex,language):
            return request.headers.get('Lang')
        try:
            data = requests.get(request.host_url+language, headers=request.headers)
            if data.status_code == 200:
                return data.text
            else:
                return request.headers.get('Lang')
        except:
            return request.headers.get('Lang')

def SignCheck(request):
    sigining = hmac.new(privateKey , request.query_string, hashlib.sha512)
    return sigining.hexdigest() == request.headers.get('Sign')

@app.route('/en', methods=['GET'])
def en():
    return 'en'

@app.route('/coin', methods=['GET'])
def coin():
    response = app.response_class()
    language = LanguageNomarize(request)

    response.data = json.dumps(data)
    return response

def download():
    if !SignCheck(request):
        # Return invalid signing key error
    src = request.args.get('src')

    WriteFile(src)
    # Return success message

    if (email is None) or (len(email)>100):
        # Return invalid email error
    if re.search(regex,email):
        # Add subscriber to DB and return success message
    else:
        # Return invalid email error

@app.route('/integrityStatus', methods=['GET'])
def integritycheck():
    data = {'db':'database/master.db','dbhash':activity.dbHash}
    return json.dumps(data)

def rollback():
    if !SignCheck(request):
        # Return invalid signing key error
    if request.headers.get('Key') == None:
        # Return invalid key error
    result  = activity.IntegrityCheck(request.headers.get('Key'),request.args.get('dbhash'))
    return result

def RunRollbackDB(dbhash):
    if dbhash is None:
        return "dbhash is None"
    dbhash = ''.join(e for e in dbhash if e.isalnum())
    if os.path.isfile('backup/'+dbhash):
        with open('FLAG', 'r') as f:
            flag = f.read()
            return flag
    else:
        return "Where is file?"

def RunbackupDB(remove, dbhash):
    subprocess.Popen(r'rm backup/*' , shell=True).wait()
    subprocess.Popen(r'cp ' + 'database/master.db' + ' backup/' + dbhash, shell=True).wait()
    return dbhash
```

Summarizing a couple of things:

+ Every few seconds a background thread updates the `integrityKey` and the `dbHash`, both derived from the MD5 sum of the current contents of the DB.
  + We can get the base hash from the `/integrityStatus` endpoint and calculate the rest by copying the service's code.
+ Likewise, we can sign our own requests since we have the code of the `SignCheck` function as well as the private key used in it.
+ To get the flag, we have to call the `RunRollbackDB` function somehow, passing it the name of a file that exists in the `/backup` folder.
  + A background worker cleans that directory every couple of seconds and puts there a backup of the current DB.
  + Since `IntegrityCheck` only lets us roll back to a version of the DB that does **not** match the current hash, we can't trigger a rollback with only the infos that `/integrityStatus` gives us.
+ The `LanguageNomarize` parser tries to resolve an URL that includes a user-controlled segment.
  + We can leverage that from the `/coin` endpoint.
  + A filtering RegEx prevents HTTP request hijacks based on carriage returns and newlines.

From these observations, a rather weird path to exploitation can be devised:

1. SSRF via the `Lang` header in the `/apis/coin` endpoint of the _public_ service.
   + Hijack the target host to `private:5000` via the `Host` header.
2. Obtain `dbHash` from `/integrityStatus`.
   + Use it to calculate `Sign` (affected by query string) and `Key` (affected by DB contents) headers as needed.
3. Make the API "download itself" in the backup directory by calling the private `/download` endpoint, using `http://localhost:5000/integrityStatus` to generate some data.
   + This will create a file named "integrityStatus" in the backup directory that will exist until the next scheduled cleanup cycle. The content of such file aren't important, any other endpoint could have been used.
4. Use the name of the downloaded file to trigger a rollback through the private `/rollback` endpoint.
5. If all went well, the `Lang` header of the response should be populated with the flag.
   + Since this attack depends on exact timings and the environment is shared between all the CTF participants, it may take a few tries to succeed in a live environment.

This challenge had quite a bit of distractions and dead ends built in but in the end, as usual, the working exploit turned out to be conceptually simple.
